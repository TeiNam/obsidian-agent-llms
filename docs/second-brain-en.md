This guide describes **0.7.11**.

This document covers the vault search (Graph RAG) and knowledge-writing (Second Brain) layers in detail. For installation and basic usage, see the README.

> Command palette labels follow the UI language you pick in settings. The names quoted below are the English ones; restart Obsidian after switching languages, since the palette is cached at load time.

### Graph RAG Vault Search

Search combines vector similarity with the link graph instead of ranking whole notes by a single embedding.

- **Chunk-level embeddings** — Each note is split into chunks (default 2,000 characters, 200-character overlap) and every chunk is embedded.
- **Graph traversal** — Seed notes found by vector search are expanded along their outlinks and backlinks. Depth is 0–3 hops (default 1); `0` disables traversal and returns seeds only.
- **Combined score** — Relevance *multiplied* by graph distance decay: `relevance × 0.5^hop`, in the range 0.0–1.0. A seed sits at hop 0, so its combined score is its own normalized similarity. A neighbor's relevance is a weighted blend of its own similarity (0.6) and its seed's similarity (0.4); if the neighbor's own similarity is unavailable, the seed's score is used alone.
- **Minimum relevance threshold 0.55** — Applied to relevance *before* hop decay, not to the combined score. Normalization maps cosine 0 (orthogonal, unrelated) to 0.5, so the threshold drops clearly unrelated candidates instead of showing them as "50% related". Applying it after decay would eliminate every graph neighbor, since a hop-1 neighbor's theoretical maximum is `1.0 × 0.5 = 0.5`.
- **Embedding model change detection** — The index stores a `{provider}:{model}` signature and the vector dimension. When either changes, stale vectors are discarded, search falls back to keyword matching, and you are told to re-index.
- **Dimension mismatch** — Notes whose vectors have a different dimension are treated as "not comparable" instead of being scored, so they cannot tie with everything else.
- **Hybrid search** — A keyword pass runs alongside the vector pass, and the two rankings are merged by reciprocal rank fusion (`k = 60`). The keyword list carries half the weight of the vector list, because embeddings are the primary signal here; on its own, a note that merely repeats a word could outrank a note that actually answers the question. Two result slots are reserved for candidates that only the keyword pass found, so exact strings — error codes, function names, version numbers — are not lost to embedding similarity.
- **Matched text** — Results carry the text of the chunk that actually matched (capped at 2,000 characters), not the opening of the note. A note found through a passage near its end would otherwise hand the model an excerpt that does not contain the reason it was found.
- **Incremental indexing** — File create, modify, rename, and delete events update the index with a 2-second debounce. Up to two files are indexed at a time, but repeated events for the *same* path stay in order, so a create-then-delete cannot land backwards. Bulk changes such as moving a folder are therefore throttled rather than fired at the embedding API all at once.

The embedding model is chosen from a dropdown under Settings → Agent LLMs → **Model Settings**. On the Bedrock backend it has no default, so pick one before indexing.

The embedding signature follows the format `{provider}:{model ID}`. Examples: `bedrock:amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0`, `openai:text-embedding-3-large`, `ollama:nomic-embed-text`, `gemini:text-embedding-004`

Settings → Agent LLMs → **Graph RAG Search**:

| Setting | Default | Range |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Graph Traversal Depth | 1 | 0–3 (`0` disables traversal) |
| Chunk Max Size | 2000 characters | minimum 1 |
| Chunk Overlap | 200 characters | must be smaller than chunk max size |

**Cost:** one embedding call per search query. Indexing costs one embedding call per chunk. No chat completion call is made by search itself.

**Data sent for indexing:** notes and supported text attachments are split into chunks and sent to the configured embedding API. Remote endpoints receive that text. To process embedding requests on this device, select an Ollama server running locally.

### Second Brain Layer

The Second Brain Layer adds an active write layer on top of Graph RAG's read layer. It can create and update notes inside one folder that you designate.

**It is opt-in and off by default.** While **Enable Second Brain** is off, no note is created, modified, or deleted automatically, and every Second Brain command refuses to run.

Settings → Agent LLMs → **Second Brain**:

| Setting | Default | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Enable Second Brain | Off | Master switch for the whole write layer |
| Wiki Folder | `Second Brain` | Root folder where generated notes live |
| Enable Scheduler | Off | Checks on startup and every 30 minutes; runs cleanup once the configured interval has elapsed |
| Scheduler Interval (hours) | 24 | Minimum 1 |

#### Will the AI overwrite my notes?

No — and there are three separate reasons why.

**1. Read-only tools never touch a note.** The thinking tools return text into the chat and write nothing.

| Tool | Command palette | What it does | Writes notes? | LLM calls |
|------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| `challenge` | Challenge a claim (challenge) | Critiques a claim's gaps, counterexamples, and assumptions using your past notes as evidence | No | 1 |
| `connect` | Connect two topics (connect) | Searches two topics separately and derives what links them | No | 1 |
| `emerge` | Find recent patterns (emerge) | Finds unnamed patterns across notes modified in the last N days | No | 1 |
| `reconcile_topic` | Check contradictions (reconcile) | Reports contradictions between notes on a topic | No | 1 |

`emerge` reads the index directly instead of searching, and caps input at the 60 most recently modified notes; if more matched, the response says how many were analyzed.

**2. Generating tools write only inside the Wiki Folder.**

| Tool | Command palette | What it writes | LLM calls |
|------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|
| `synthesize_topic` | Synthesize topic (synthesize) | Creates or updates a wiki note summarizing notes on a topic. Writes nothing if the search returns no results. | 1 |
| `architect` | Codebase architect (architect) | Creates or updates `Architecture.md` with `overview`, `modules`, and `decisions` sections. The scanned module skeleton is capped at 400 lines. | 3 (one per section) |
| `create_wiki_note` | Create wiki note | Creates a note from a title and body you supply | 0 |
| `update_index` | Update wiki index | Rewrites the `index.md` catalog of the Wiki Folder | 0 |

Tools that search the vault also make one embedding call per query — `connect` searches twice, so it makes two. `emerge` and `architect` make none, because they enumerate the index and the vault file list instead of searching.

**3. Sentinel blocks preserve everything you wrote.** Generated regions are wrapped in markers:

```markdown
<!-- @generated:synthesis -->
Content the plugin owns. This region is replaced on every run.
<!-- @end:synthesis -->

Your own notes live outside the markers and are never rewritten.
```

On regeneration, only the marked block is replaced, so notes you added to the same file survive. Updates are idempotent: if the new content is identical, the file is not rewritten at all — which also keeps its modification time from polluting "recently modified" note selection. Markers that appear inside LLM output are neutralized so a response cannot forge or break a block.

Block keys currently in use: `synthesis` (synthesize), `overview` / `modules` / `decisions` (architect), `catalog` (`index.md`), `knowledge-gaps` (gap report), `reconcile` (contradiction review), `related-links` (link suggestions), `canonical-candidates` (duplicate candidates), `decisions` (decision ledger).

#### Additional safeguards

- Writes outside the Wiki Folder are rejected, including `..` traversal, absolute paths, and drive letters.
- Enable **Confirm note changes and MCP tools** in settings to confirm tools that create, edit, delete, or move notes, including the generating tools above, and every external MCP tool. This option is off by default.
- If a result is produced while the index is stale (embedding model changed), a warning is appended telling you to re-index and re-run.

#### Scheduler

The cleanup pipeline runs five non-destructive steps in order: ensure the wiki folders exist → refresh the `index.md` catalog → write the knowledge gap report → refresh the Bases dashboard → append to the activity log.

Step failures are isolated, so the remaining steps still run. If every step fails, the last-run timestamp is not updated. Automatic retries wait for a one-hour cooldown within the current app session, then run at the next eligible check.

With both Second Brain and the scheduler enabled, the plugin checks on startup and every **30 minutes** while Obsidian remains open. It runs the pipeline only when the configured interval (default **24 hours**) has elapsed; the check interval is not the cleanup interval. Nothing runs while Obsidian is closed. With Second Brain enabled, **Run Second Brain cleanup (scheduler)** runs it on demand even if the scheduler toggle is off. The pipeline makes no LLM calls.

### Approval-Based Cleanup

Five commands propose changes and then wait. Each opens a list you tick item by item; nothing is written until you approve, and what gets written goes into a sentinel block, so your own text in the same file survives.

| Command | What it proposes | LLM calls to apply |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|
| Review and apply contradictions (reconcile → apply) | Corrections for statements that conflict across notes on one topic | 0 — the check already ran |
| Suggest links (connect orphan and stub notes) | Links from orphan and stub notes to related notes | 0 |
| Review duplicate candidates (canonical note and aliases) | A canonical note plus aliases for notes covering the same subject | 0 |
| Extract decisions → ledger (decisions) | Decisions with rationale, owner, deadline, and sources | 0 — extraction already ran |
| Inbox triage (title, move, tag suggestions) | A title, target folder, and tags for newly captured notes | 0 — the suggestions already ran |

**Link suggestions** require a similarity of at least 0.82 and propose at most three links per note. The approved links are appended in a `related-links` block, and re-running replaces that block rather than appending duplicates.

**Duplicate candidates** require a similarity of at least 0.9, and a cluster holds at most 8 notes. **Nothing is deleted or merged.** The canonical note gets `aliases` in its frontmatter plus a `canonical-candidates` block listing the rest, so you can merge them yourself — or decide they were not duplicates after all.

**The decision ledger** lives at `{Wiki Folder}/Decisions.md`. Merging keeps values you edited there and fills only empty fields, with one exception: status moves forward only (`open` → `done` → `superseded`) and never back. A superseded decision is marked, not deleted, because the fact that you once decided otherwise is itself worth keeping.

**Inbox triage** handles at most 12 notes per run, oldest-modified last. Renames go through Obsidian's link-preserving API, so links pointing at the old name follow the file. If the target name already exists, the move is skipped and the tags are still applied.

**Cost:** applying costs 0 LLM calls in every case. Producing the proposals costs 1 LLM call for contradictions, decisions, and triage; link suggestions and duplicate candidates cost 0, because they run on index embeddings alone.

### Citation Verification

When an answer cites a note, the cited path is checked against the index and any `#heading` anchor against that note's headings. Unresolved citations are listed under the answer.

- Paths are matched the way Obsidian resolves links, by path suffix: a citation of `Projects/Note` resolves `Archive/Projects/Note.md`.
- Code spans and fenced code blocks are skipped, so a path inside an example is not treated as a citation.
- External links (anything with a URI scheme, protocol-relative URLs, and bare fragments) are ignored.
- The check runs on restored messages too, so reopening the sidebar or loading a saved session shows the same warnings.

This catches the specific failure where a model produces a plausible-looking note path that does not exist. The answer is still shown — only flagged.

**Cost:** 0 LLM calls, 0 embedding calls.

### Note Links

Every generated link is written by one shared formatter, so the same rules hold everywhere the plugin writes a link.

- Links point at the **path** with the extension removed, and the note's title becomes the alias: `[[path/to/note|Title]]`. Titles are not link targets — a note's title comes from its first `# H1`, which frequently differs from its filename.
- `#` and `|` cannot be escaped inside a wikilink; `#` starts an anchor and the first `|` starts the alias. When a path or alias contains one, the link falls back to a percent-encoded markdown link, which Obsidian resolves the same way.
- Anchor links are only written when the heading is safe to use as one; otherwise the citation falls back to the note as a whole.

### Frontmatter Property Search

Beyond folder, tags, and date range, vault search can filter on any frontmatter property.

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `=` / `!=` | Equal / not equal |
| `>` `>=` `<` `<=` | Numeric and date comparison |
| `~` | Substring contains |

Dot notation reaches nested keys, so `project.status = active` matches a nested `project: { status: active }`.

Invalid filters are **reported, not dropped.** A model that passes `modifiedAfter: "last month"` would otherwise receive whole-vault results and never learn the condition was ignored — and neither would you.

Dates are parsed in **local time.** `new Date("2026-09-01")` is UTC midnight, which in KST is 09:00 on September 1st, so a note written that morning would fall outside "after September 1st". The index stores local file times, so the filter matches.

**Cost:** no additional LLM or embedding calls — the filter runs on index data.

### AI Change Ledger and Safe Undo

Every note-changing AI action is recorded with a before/after snapshot. The last 20 are kept.

- **Undo restores the snapshot only if you have not edited the file since.** If you have, that file is skipped rather than overwritten — your edit is never the thing that gets lost.
- Snapshots cover created, modified, and deleted paths, including folders.
- Paths are validated before restore: absolute paths, `..` traversal, and empty segments are rejected.
- The ledger lives in the plugin folder, not your vault.

Open it with **Open AI change ledger**; undo the most recent action with **Undo last AI change**.

**Cost:** 0 LLM calls, 0 embedding calls.

### Attachment RAG

`.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`, and `.html` files in your vault are indexed as chunks and searched alongside notes, rather than read once into a single conversation and discarded.

They participate in the same pipeline as notes: chunk embeddings, keyword fusion, and graph traversal where links exist. Re-indexing follows the same file events.

### Source Provenance, Outdated Marks, and Regeneration Diff

A synthesis note records **a content hash per source chunk**, not just the source paths.

- When a source's content changes, its hash no longer matches and the note is marked outdated. A path that still exists is not enough to call a synthesis current.
- Regenerating shows a **diff** (capped at 40 lines) of what changed, so you can see whether the update was substantive before accepting it.
- Provenance lives in its own `synthesis-provenance` sentinel block, so it is replaced on regeneration while your own text survives.

### Bases Dashboard

Generates a `.base` file with four views built from vault data:

| View | Content |
|------|---------|
| Decision ledger | Decisions with status, owner, and due date |
| Open questions | Questions recorded but not yet answered |
| Outdated knowledge | Notes whose sources changed after synthesis |
| Review queue | Well-linked notes you have not opened in a while |

Run **Refresh and open Agent LLMs dashboard**, or let the scheduler pipeline refresh it.

- Generated files carry a marker. **A file without that marker is never overwritten** — if a path collides with something you wrote, the run fails loudly instead of destroying it.
- Projections that disappear are **deactivated, not deleted** (`dashboard_active: false`), so notes you added to a generated file survive.

**Cost:** 0 LLM calls, 0 embedding calls.

### Knowledge Gap Report

Search answers "what do I know". This report answers "where are the holes", computed locally from index data.

Four metrics:

| Metric | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Referenced but missing | Several notes link to a note that does not exist yet |
| Referenced but thin | Has backlinks but under 200 characters of body text |
| Orphan | No outlinks and no backlinks — searchable, but unreachable by graph traversal |
| One-way link | A links to B with no reference back |

The top 20 entries are written to `{Wiki Folder}/Knowledge Gaps.md` inside a sentinel block. Ordering is deterministic so the block does not churn between runs. Nothing is auto-fixed — the report only tells you where to look. Notes inside the Wiki Folder are excluded so generated output does not pollute the statistics.

Run it with **Refresh knowledge gap report**, or let the scheduler pipeline do it.

**Cost:** 0 LLM calls, 0 embedding calls.

### Review Queue

Once a vault is large, knowledge you cannot recall a search term for is effectively gone. The queue resurfaces 5 notes at a time that you have not opened in a while but that are well connected.

- Score is elapsed days plus link count, each capped so age alone cannot dominate.
- Notes under 200 characters and notes already surfaced within the last 7 days are excluded.
- No grading field is written into your notes. Access history is stored only in plugin settings.
- Before any access history exists, the note's modification time is used instead, so the queue is not a tie.
- Entries for deleted or moved notes are pruned from the history.

Run it with **Review queue (notes to revisit)**. Click a row to open the note.

**Cost:** 0 LLM calls, 0 embedding calls.

### Conversation Harvest

Chat sessions are capped at 50, so older ones are dropped silently and their conclusions are lost. Harvesting moves what is worth keeping into the vault.

Open the chat history (session list) and click the sprout icon on a session. The result is saved to `{Wiki Folder}/Conversations/YYYY-MM-DD Title.md`.

- Only conclusions, decisions, rationale, and open questions are extracted. The raw transcript is not included — small talk and dead ends should not become search evidence.
- The saved note is indexed, so it becomes evidence for later searches.
- Manual trigger only; nothing is harvested automatically.
- Requires Second Brain to be enabled.

**Cost:** 1 LLM call per harvest.

### Retrospective Chain

Retrospectives are triggered from the chat input: type "회고", "retrospective", or "振り返り" and send it. There is no toolbar button for it.

When a daily retrospective is generated, the retrospective sections from the last 7 days are included as input, so recurring problems and whether they improved stay visible instead of resetting each day.

Only the retrospective section of each past day is used, truncated to 1,000 characters per day — not the whole daily note. If there are no past retrospectives, behavior is unchanged.

**Cost:** no additional LLM calls. It is still the single call the retrospective always made.
